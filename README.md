# About the Project

The main objective of this analysis is to shed light on what attributes to a low-risk or high-risk flight in order to improve the company's pricing decisions.

After identifying the attributes, a classification rule is proposed to label flights according to their calculated risk.

# Project Files Description

**Data_Analyst_Take_Home_Challenge.pdf** - Contains all the business case context and information.

**Flight Delay Analysis.ipynb** - Notebook with the analysis.

**Flight Delay Claim Analysis.pdf** - Business Presentation to show the findings of the analysis.

**flight_delays_data.csv** - Data set with flight delay claims from 2013/01 to 2016/07. The schema is included in the notebook.


# Requirements

* Python3
* Jupyter Notebook

# Usage

It is recommended to run this project on a virtual environment. Here are the steps I followed to do so on macOS 10:

Set a desired folder as current directory:
```
cd Folder
```
    
Create desired directory:
```
mkdir Flight_Delay_Analysis
```
Make it the cd:
```
cd Flight_Delay_Analysis
``` 
Create virtual enviroment:
```
python3 -m venv Test_Project/venv
``` 
Activate virtual environment:
```
source Flight_Delay_Analysis/venv/bin/activate
```
Launch Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```



# Libraries

All libraries used in the main file are already pre-installed on Python3 so you will only have to import them as they are in the code.
